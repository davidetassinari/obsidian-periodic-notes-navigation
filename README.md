The insipiration definitely came from some Obsidian forum post that I did not think of noting. To further complicate matters, most of the coding was done by Claude, so it's hard to know where my own digging starts and where LLM pre-training begins. If you feel like you deserve credit, reach out and I'll be happy to oblige.
